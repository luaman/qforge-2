NEWS for quake2
===============

0.4 (Whenever)
---

* New ALSA sound driver.  See Bug#27.
* Netgraph is slightly smaller, with transparent background, and is drawn
  behind the players stats.  See Bug#4.
* Netgraph no longer breaks transparent console.  See Bug#4.
* fs_basedir now honors PKGDATADIR and PKGLIBDIR, so mods can be 
  installed like everyone is used to (e.g. /usr/local/share/quake2/ctf)
  See Bug#8.
* fs_gamedir is exported to environment as QUAKE2_HOME on startup.
  Mods may safely use this variable to perform file io in their respective
  homes.
* Timedemo is disabled in deathmatch mode, and readonly in dedicated
  mode.  Timedemo in dm is not only stupid, but it can crash the server :)
  See Bug#28.
* The rocket launcher is now eligible for selection when a player runs 
  out of ammo.  It was previously skipped.  This is a long-standing bug
  from id's original game source.  Affects both ctf and baseq2 games.
  See Bug#29.
* FS_OpenFile now ensures a file is a regular file before returning it.  This
  fixes a known server crash (e.g. cmd download maps)  See Bug#30.
* Fixed Win32 path bug in download command that could allow retrieval
  of sensitive information (e.g. cmd download \/server.cfg).  See Bug#30.
* Fixed unchecked strcpy in Cmd_TokenizeString which could allow
  arbitrary code execution.  See Bug#30.
* link command is now jailed to fs_gamedir, fixing an exploit to allow
  random filesystem access to players with rcon (e.g. rcon link /etc foo;
  download foo/passwd).  See Bug#30.
* Fixed unchecked memcpy in Cbuf_Execute which could allow arbitrary
  code execution.  See Bug#30.
* Unix-like cmd/cvar completion.  All potential matches for commands
  and cvars are printed on tab.  Nothing is appended to the input buffer
  unless it is an exact, or only, match.  Commands are printed in green,
  cvars in white.
* A toggle option for _windowed_mouse is now available in the OpenGL
  video menu.  The cvar is defaulted to "1" for glx and sdl_* renderers,
  as it helps some configurations (read: NVidia).  See Bug#12.
* configure.in no longer globbers OpenGL and SVGALib CFLAGS.  This
  was causing problems on FreeBSD.  See Bug#25.

0.3 (16/03/04)
---

* Pluggable sound driver architecture, sound output drivers configurable
  at runtime: oss, alsa, ao, sdl, solaris.
* Fixed joystick when using softx video refresher.

0.2.2 (25/02/04)
-----

* ALSA and libao sound drivers added -- configurable at compile time.
* Updates to fix compile errors with gcc 3.3.

0.2.1 (06/02/03)
-----

* Important fix to the build system to include *all* the source files,
  especially the i386 assembler, when building the release tarballs on
  non-i386 architectures.

0.2 (30/01/03)
---

* Major refresher segfault fixed.  Video refreshers can now be switched *in
  the game* just like you expect!  No more libltdl!
* Solaris support to core game, X11, and GLX refreshers.
* RPM, Debian (CVS only), and Solaris packaging support.
* X11 key repeat bug fixed.
* Joystick support for Linux systems.
* Build system bugfixes for FreeBSD and OpenBSD, general auto* fixes.
* Updated documentation.
* Numerous minor bugfixes.

0.1 (17/09/02)
---

* SDL support for software and OpenGL modes.
* Quake2 no longer is dependent on architecture.  Heavy use of autoconf to
  configure the code for your architecture.
* Linux FHS compliant through the use of automake to install dynamic
  libraries into the right place, data files loaded from the share directory.
* Mouse wheel support, mouse buttons 4 and 5 supported under SDL.
* Big Gun and savegame crashes fixed.
* Sony VAIO Picturebook and Apple Titanium Powerbook video resolution support.
* Support for the Xatrix and Rogue missionpacks (separate source download
  required).
* OpenGL stencilbuffer shadows.
* Fixed macro expansion rcon_password server exploit.
* Miscellaneous bugfixes.
