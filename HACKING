HACKING on quake2
=================

Note to developers: bsd/, irix/ and solaris/ are NO LONGER PERTINENT!

linux/ was renamed src/, so hack in there.  As we port to more arch/os's,
we'll integrate the old os subdirs into src/, and remove the old trees.


If you want to hack on something, but don't know where to start, have a look
at TODO in the top level source tree, or open a browser at

http://bugs.quakeforge.net/bugs/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=quake2&archive=no

for the currently open bug reports.
