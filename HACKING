HACKING on quake2
=================

To build quake2 from CVS, you will need the following software:
 - automake, 1.6
 - autoconf, 2.50 or higher
 - GNU make

Start by running gnu make, it'll read the GNUmakefile first and build the
build system.

Note to developers: bsd/, irix/ and solaris/ are NO LONGER PERTINENT!  This
isn't meant to scare you, but merely inform that you shouldn't be using the
code in those directories for anything but a reference.  If you use one of
these systems, please attempt to merge in the code from these directories
into the main tree, `src'.  The old code will eventually be removed.

If you want to hack on something, but don't know where to start, have a look
at TODO in the top level source tree, or open a browser at

http://bugs.quakeforge.net/bugs/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=quake2&archive=no

for the currently open bug reports.




Adding a new screen resolution
------------------------------

Open up src/vid_so.c and find the array "vid_modes".  Append your resolution
to this array:
	{ "Mode n: RESxRES", RES, RES, n }

Open up src/vid_menu.c and find the array "resolutions" in VID_MenuInit().
Append your resolution so it is the same index as your addition to vid_modes.

Save both, rebuild.
