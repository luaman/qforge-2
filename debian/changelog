quake2 (1:0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Removed patch to VAIO Picturebook and TiBook resolutions.
    - Removed patch for rcon_password exploit.
    - Removed patch for SDL mouse buttons 2 and 3.
    - Removed patch for broken ALSA OSS emulation.
    - Removed patch for other compile warnings that are also fixed in the
      new upstream code.
  * Removed quake2.sh, as libGL.so.1 is set as the correct gl_driver in the
    code, and gamma is handled internally (at least, the GLX refresher does).
    If you find that your favourite refresher doesn't do gamma, file a bug
    and I'll reinstate the wrapper script.
  * Removed Depends: xbase-clients as the wrapper script is no longer
    used.

  * Changed SDL LDFLAGS to use --plugin-libs as per

quake2 (3.21.cvs20020126-1) unstable; urgency=low

    just the raw code released from iD, and hence no official upstream to
    fix bugs.
  * Removed SDL patch from diff, as it is incorporated in upstream.
  * Added a call to xgamma from the quake2 shell script to modify gamma
    settings when using OpenGL renderers.
