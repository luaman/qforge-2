If you are checking this out from CVS, run the bootstrap command first to set
up configure.  Then follow the instructions in INSTALL.

*** HARD HAT AREA ***
I am halfway through migrating the codebase to use autotools, so not everything
will build just yet.  Please be patient.

Note to developers: bsd/, irix/ and solaris/ are NO LONGER PERTINENT!
The relevant code was merged into src/ along with the linux/ subtree, so do
your edits there.
They exist only as reference in case the merge mucked up anything, they will
be removed as soon as I can be sure that the code merge worked.
