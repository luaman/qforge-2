If you are checking this out from CVS, run the bootstrap command first to set
up configure.  Then follow the instructions in INSTALL.

Use --disable-asm on the configure line if you want to use the software
refreshers on i386, or better yet, fix the bug in the asm!

Note to developers: bsd/, irix/ and solaris/ are NO LONGER PERTINENT!
The relevant code was merged into src/ along with the linux/ subtree, so do
your edits there.
They exist only as reference in case the merge mucked up anything, they will
be removed as soon as I can be sure that the code merge worked.
