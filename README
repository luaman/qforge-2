README for quake2
=================

Compiling
---------

If you are checking this out from CVS, run the bootstrap command first to set
up configure.  You will need autoconf 2.50, automake 1.6, libtool 1.4, or
greater.  Then follow the instructions in INSTALL.

Save Games
----------

Save games are tied to the build of quake2 that they were created with.
You can *not* use old save games with new versions of the code (well, you
can hack the savegame loader to allow this, but you may find yourself
experiencing interesting and obscure segfaults in the game).

The simple workaround is to *not upgrade* if you are in the middle of
a single player game.

Mission Packs
-------------

To build the Xatrix and Rogue missionpacks, download the sharballs from id
Software's FTP site:

ftp://idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/sources/

uncompress them, and run them in src/xatrix or src/rogue

In src/Makefile.am, swap the comments on the SUBDIR lines, and run ./bootstrap
from the top level.  Rerun configure and make.
