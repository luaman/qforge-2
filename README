README for quake2
=================

Compiling
---------

If you are checking this out from CVS, type ``make'' (or ``gmake'' if your
make is not GNU Make) first to set up configure.  You will need autoconf
2.50, automake 1.6, libtool 1.4, or greater.  Then follow the instructions
in INSTALL.

When specifying locations to arguments like --with-svgalib (i.e. all the
options that can take a DIR argument as shown by ./configure --help), use
the directory that contains the lib/ and include/ directories; e.g:
	./configure --with-svgalib=/usr/local
instead of
	./configure --with-svgalib=/usr/local/lib
as configure will automatically look for the libraries and headers in
the paths relative to the given path.

Installing the game data
------------------------

The game data is searched for in ${prefix}/share/quake2/baseq2/ (which by
default is /usr/local/share/quake2/baseq2/).  If, when you start the game,
you get an error that pics/colormap.pcx cannot be found, it means that
pak0.pak is not in the game data path.  Check what prefix you gave to
configure, and make sure you have pak0.pak in the right directory.

The configure script will inform you of the directory that Quake2Forge
thinks your game data will be in.

Save Games
----------

Save games are tied to the build of quake2 that they were created with.
You can *not* use old save games with new versions of the code (well, you
can hack the savegame loader to allow this, but you may find yourself
experiencing interesting and obscure segfaults in the game).

The simple workaround is to *not upgrade* if you are in the middle of
a single player game.

Mission Packs
-------------

To build the Xatrix and Rogue missionpacks, download the sharballs from id
Software's FTP site:

ftp://idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/sources/

uncompress them, and run the shar in src/xatrix or src/rogue
