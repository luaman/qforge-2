- merge net_udp6.c into net_udp.c
- kill off ctf/q_shared.c, it's identical to src/q_shared.c (Actually, work
  out redundant code and merge them... maybe some sort of libshared.a)
- clean up the #ifdefs that are throughout the code to be has-a
  tests instead of is-a. (using HAVE_* from configure instead of __blerg__)
- separate the video refreshers
- the video refresher loader code in src/vid_menu.c needs cleaning up, it's
  utter bollocks at the moment.  all the structs are very fragile, depending
  on specific ordering of each element.
- do va_list audit -- check that argptr isn't used twice (as per 
http://gozer.quakeforge.net/list-archives/quakeforge-cvs/2002-April/000151.html
  Everything seems to be fine, someone with a PPC machine will probably want
  to double check this.
- investigate the possibility of savegames not being tied to a particular build
- split out assembler per arch/os (we currently have gas i386 and win i386)
- make sure that we give back the mouse and keyboard if the game crashes
